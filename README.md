# KeyChain Africa

KeyChain Africa is a secure, decentralized web platform for password management, designed specifically for African users.

It allows users to store their credentials and sensitive access information locally in an encrypted manner, while timestamping every action (creation, modification, deletion, sharing) on the Polygon blockchain to ensure traceability and integrity.

Thanks to the integration of the Lightning Network (via Polar during development), it also offers a unique system for temporary secure password sharing, validated by Lightning micropayment.

The application works offline, is lightweight, multilingual, and accessible from both web browsers and mobile devices, featuring a simple interface tailored to the African context.
